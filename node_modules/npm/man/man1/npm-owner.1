ls: List all the users who have access to modify a package and push new
versions\.  Handy when you need to know who to bug for help\.
.IP \(bu 2

to modify metadata, publish new versions, and add other owners\.
.IP \(bu 2

.RE
.P
Note that there is only one level of access\.  Either you can modify a package,
or you can't\.  Future versions may contain more fine\-grained access levels, but
that is not implemented at this time\.
.P
If you have two\-factor authentication enabled with \fBauth\-and\-writes\fP (see
npm help \fBnpm\-profile\fP) then you'll need to include an otp
on the command line when changing ownership with \fB\-\-otp\fP\|\.

This is a one\-time password from a two\-factor authenticator\. It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with \fBnpm access\fP\|\.

If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one\-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one\.
